# **Cybersecurity Skills Framework**

A free, open, and customizable web-based tool developed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) and the Linux Foundation to help organizations assess and build cybersecurity skills across various IT roles. The framework provides skill mapping for 14 job families at different experience levels and aligns with industry standards like NIST NICE, DoD 8140, and ICT e-CF.

## 
**Motivation**

Todayâ€™s organizations face an urgent need to build cybersecurity capacity across their software, DevOps, operations, and GRC teams. However, most frameworks are overly complex, vendor-driven, or narrowly scoped.

This initiative addresses the need for a simplified, practical, and open cybersecurity skills framework that is:

- Role-based and job family-oriented
- Lightweight and customizable
- Mapped to real-world proficiencies and responsibilities
- Open source and vendor-neutral

Use cases include:

- Building internal security career paths
- Mapping workforce training needs
- Conducting cybersecurity skills assessments
- Bridging the gap between HR, team leads, and technical staff

## 
**Objective**

To provide an open-source, extensible cybersecurity skills framework that:

- Defines clear roles and responsibilities across 14 job families
- Maps each role to foundational, intermediate, and advanced skill levels
- Aligns with common cybersecurity standards and frameworks
- Encourages adoption across enterprises, education, and governments

**OKRs (Optional)**

- Increase adoption across at least 100 organizations within the first year
- Add support for 5+ additional job roles based on community feedback
- Release annual updates based on contributor input and industry changes

## 
**Scope**

**In Scope:**

- Development and maintenance of the framework web tool
- Updates to job families, skills, and mappings
- Alignment with widely recognized standards
- Community feedback integration

**Out of Scope:**

- Offering proprietary training content or certifications
- Providing enterprise consulting or support services
